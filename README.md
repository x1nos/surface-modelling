# Surface modelling on a retired laptop and  FreeCAD software

FreeCAD and HP Elitebook 8470w

* In the following I will present my experiences with an advanced 3d-cad surface modelling project, which was carried out on a laptop that is about 11 years old.
   
* I used the Linux operating system and the open source FreeCAD software for modelling.
  
* I have always been somewhat against the endless replacement of equipment, often for very small upgrades.
  
* For this reason I have been looking for alternatives to extend the life cycle of the computing technology I use.
  
* If the life cycle of equipment could be extended, this would reduce the need for new production.
  
* This could also guide the design criteria for equipment towards longer life cycle products.
  
* All this would have a positive impact on achieving the goals of sustainable development and the circular economy.
  
* Includes a comparison with commercial 3d-cad modelling software.

* The project has been carried out in the course "Principles of repurposing electronics 521229A" at the University of Oulu. 

* By opening the 521229A-V2.pdf file you can read a more detailed description of the project.
